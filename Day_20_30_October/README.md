##### [Notebook Submission](https://github.com/shashwatk1/IPL_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Day_20_30_October/Day_20.ipynb)
## Questions

### Q1. Who will win the match?
- [ ] KXIP
- [ ] RR

### Q2. Which batsman will have the highest (# of runs scored through boundaries) to (total runs scored) ratio in the match? Consider only those players who play more than 10 balls.
- [ ] Sanju Samson or KL Rahul
- [ ] Chris Gayle or Steve Smith
- [ ] Robbie Uthappa or Jos Butler
- [ ] Others 

### Q3. Consider a new metric called "Overall Player Performance" that can be considered for batsmen and bowlers. The formula for OPP for every batsman is given as - [(# of runs scored by the player/# of balls faced by the player) + (# of runs scored off boundaries) - (# of runs scored off 1s, 2s and 3s)/(Total balls faced by the player)]. Once you compute the OPP for every batsman, you're supposed to normalise it using the formula : [(OPP of batsman - min(OPP among all batsmen))/(max(OPP among all batsmen)-min(OPP among all batsmen))]. For a bowler, the OPP formula is given as - (# of boundary runs given/# of boundaries hit off the bowler in the match))/(total balls bowled by the bowler in the match)]. Just like how you normalised the OPPs for batsman, you're also supposed to normalise the OPP for bowlers. Note, the normalised OPP values for both, batsmen and bowlers, will lie between 0 and 1. If a player bats and bowls, you will have to consider both the formulae individually and sum them up to find the OPP for a player. This way, the max OPP for any player in a match would be 2. Which player do you thin will end up with the highest OPP in the match? 
- [ ] Chris Gayle or Jofra Archer
- [ ] Rahul Tewatia or KL Rahul
- [ ] Ben Stokes or Mohammed Shami
- [ ] Others 

### Q4. How many dot balls will be bowled in the entire match?
- [ ] Less than 60
- [ ] 60 - 90
- [ ] 91 - 120
- [ ] 121 or more

### Q5. How many balls will Mohammed Shami take to get his first wicket?
- [ ] 0 - 6
- [ ] 7 - 12
- [ ] 13 - 18
- [ ] 19 - 24 or he won't take a wicket
