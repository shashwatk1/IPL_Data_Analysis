## Questions
### Q1. Who will win the match?
- [ ] RR
- [ ] MI

### Q2. Consider a new metric called the "Batsman Intimidation Score" which can be computed for every batsman using the formula : [(Total runs scored by the batsman + # of runs scored off boundaries - (# of runs scored by the batsman through 1s, 2s or 3s)*0.5)/(# of balls faced by the batsman)]. The higher the BIS, the better the performance of the batsman. Which batsman from the match do you think will perform the best? [NOTE : Consider only those batsman who play 10 balls or more] 
- [ ] Quinton De Kock or Steve Smith
- [ ] Kieron Pollard or Ishan Kishan
- [ ] Sanju Samson or Hardik Pandya
- [ ] Others 

### Q3. Which individual batsman in the match will have the best (number of runs scored off boundaries):(total runs scored) ratio? 
- [ ] Quinton De Kock or Sanju Samson
- [ ] Ishan Kishan or Steve Smith
- [ ] Kieron Pollard or Ben Stokes
- [ ] Others

### Q4. How many balls more/less will RR take to reach a team total of 100 as compared to MI?
- [ ] 0 - 10
- [ ] 11 - 15
- [ ] 16 - 20
- [ ] 21 or more (or) One of the teams won't score 100 runs.

### Q5. Consider the metric called "Bowler Lethality Score(BLS)" which can be computed for every bowler in a match using the formula(with some changes) : [(# of wickets taken in the match + # of dot balls bowled in a match*2 - (# of boundary runs given/# of boundaries hit off the bowler in the match))/(total balls bowled by the bowler in the match - # of dot balls bowled in a match*2.5)] The higher the BLS, the better the bowler's performance. According to the formula given and your analysis, which bowler from both CSK and MI would have the higher BLS? [NOTE : The BLS should be computed only for bowlers who bowl more than 1 over in a match] 
- [ ] Jofra Archer or Trent Boult
- [ ] Jasprit Bumrah or Rahul Tewatia
- [ ] Ben Stokes or Rahul Chahar
- [ ] Others
